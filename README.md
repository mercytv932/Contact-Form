A contact form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to enter their name, email, and a message. The form includes basic input validation to ensure all fields are filled out correctly, such as checking that the name and message meet minimum length requirements and that the email contains an “@” symbol. If any input is invalid, an error message is displayed, and if everything is valid, a success message appears and the form resets. The project features a clean, centered layout and demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and form validation, making it a great beginner-friendly frontend project for practice or a portfolio.
